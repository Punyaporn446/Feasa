#  Developed by: Carles Mart√≠nez Rius
#
#  PROJECT: getHSI
#
#  DESCRIPTION: This example demonstrates how to perform a
#  capture from the Feasa LED Analyser and then retrieve the
#  Hue, Saturation and Intensity values from a given
#  Fiber/sensor number, extracting the numerical values from
#  the string received.
#
#  This example uses a dynamic library to access to the
#  functions related to the LED Analyser. This library is read
#  in runtime, so you have to be sure that the file
#  libfeasacom_x86_64.so has been copied to the /usr/lib/
#  directory or equivalent, moreover,  some compillers/IDE
#  allow to reference the SO library from the same location
#  of the binary/script or alternative locations using absolute
#  or relative paths.
#
#  Note: there are 32 and 64-bit versions of the SO Library, so
#  one or the other has to be used depending on the compiler/IDE
#  platform or binary target platform.
