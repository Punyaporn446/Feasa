#  Developed by: Carles MartÃ­nez Rius
#
#  PROJECT: Search & Detect
#
#  DESCRIPTION: This example demonstrates how to list
#  all available Feasa devices, and also to locate
#  the port number of a connected Device based on its serial
#  number.
#
#  This example uses a dynamic library to access to the
#  functions related to the Display Tester. This library is read
#  in runtime so you have to be sure that the file feasacom64.dll
#  exists in the same location of the EXE or in windows/system32
#  folder, however some compillers allow to reference the DLL
#  library from alternative locations using absolute or relative
#  paths.
#
#  Note: there are 32 and 64-bit versions of the DLL, so one or
#  the other has to be used depending on the compiler/IDE platform
#  or binary target platform.
